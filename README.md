## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends. They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Objective
We're required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.

## Data Available
The data given in the case study contains information about bike rentals count values for year, month, season, weather, temperature, weekday, working day, holiday, humidity, windspeed, etc. 

## Conclusions
a.	The count of bike rentals are higher in the year 2019.
b.	The count of bike rentals start lowest in Spring season and rise through Summer and Fall to come back down in Winter season.
c.	The count of bike rentals are higher in Clear weather with few clouds and Misty and Cloudy weather.
d.	The seasons Summer and Fall and year 2019 affect bike rentals positively the most.
